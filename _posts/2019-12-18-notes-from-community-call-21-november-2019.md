# Notes from community call - 21 November 2019

For transparency, we're sharing the update we prepared for this community call even though no one attended the call.

## Update from the Foundation

* [First version of the Governance Exercise](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/workshops/governance-exercise.html) is available, and it will turn [into a game](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game)
* We attended [DecidimFest](https://meta.decidim.org/conferences/decidimfest19), where we met and connected with awesome people and could learn from their experiences. Ben is back in Barcelona at Smart City World Expo now, where we assume he's doing more of the same! [Here are our English notes from (some of) the Spanish and Catalan presentations](https://hackmd.io/_hNC01HAT1-6Xr21HDsQRg).
* We participated in [OSS Beyond 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/workshop-about-future-open-source-software-and-open-source-hardware) organized by the European Commission in Brussels. A clear message was delivered by the wider OSS community how important it is for the Commission to keep collaborating on Open Source. We crowdsourced notes that turned out great: [day 1](https://hackmd.io/Z552wq0wT46zD7jibJj_Tg), [day 2](https://hackmd.io/OJwtL1gnScqLv8s4Zl45lA).
